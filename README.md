# onza
Transiting exospheres

Just to be on the record, since I've seen people who forgot the reasoning behind the names of their creations, the reason why this code is called `onza` is because legends of native South-Americans tell that the explanation for eclipses is that a jaguar (or *onza* in Spanish) blocks the Sun.
